# Covid-19-Diagnosis Using CT - Images

A CNN model is designed and implemented to classify a CT image as COVID-19 positive or negative.

The influence of HyperParameters tested on CNN by training and validation the model with various values.

The Hyperparameters tested in this project are:
1) Number of Epochs and Layers

2) Input and Output Activation Function

3) Input Shape

4) Image Orientation

The dataset used in this project has been taken from https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT

The COVID-CT-Dataset has 349 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19 from 216 patients

The final Accuracy achieved was 98.6%
